Description of work:
I use a 3D array to store every cube in the 3x3 Rubik’s Cube, it can help me to confirm every cube correctly. Then in the unit cube I set a array to store 6 faces, and set functions to deal with the color of every face. In the solving process I just record the solution and perform it at last instead of performing every step. I think the major challenge for me is to find the solution by computer, because I do this project is not only to show how to solve Rubik’s Cube, but also help person like me who is not good at playing Rubik’s Cube. This took me amount time to deal with after I purchased a Rubik’s Cube. By the help of a real Rubik’s Cube, I finished this program at end, though the solution made by me is not the best.
